% Input: (n_trees,Sleep,SS_Features,hyp)
%       n_trees: Number of trees to train random forest.
%       Sleep: Features/Data used to train rf model.
%       SS_Features: Specific features within Sleep used to train rf model.
%       hyp: Annotated sleep staging to train rf model. 
% Output:
%       ss_rf: Trained random forest model.   
%       ss_rf_importance: Feature importance values for each feature.
