function [Sleep_table_Pre,removed_idx] = RBD_RF_Preprocess(Sleep_table,patient_codes,Features,numStates)
% This function pre-processes a feature able to remove rows with NaNs/infs
% and sleep stages that might not considered (movement/artifacts)
%
% Input:
%       Sleep_table:    Sleep table with all features and subjects.
%       patient_codes: 	Include subject codes included in this array eg
%                       [0,5].
%       Features:       Features to be included for pre-processing.
% Output:
%       Sleep_table_Pre:    Preprocessed table to remove nans/inf 
%                           for all included patients codes.
